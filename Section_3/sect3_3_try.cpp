/*
Section 3.3 try this exercise
Get the “name and age” example to run.
Then, modify it to write out the age in months:
read the input in years and multiply (using the * operator) by 12.
Read the age into a double to allow for children who can be very
proud of being five and a half years old rather than just five.
